# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and will actively support and provide updates for the following versions of our JavaScript animation tool:

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.13     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.10   | :x:                |

If you are using an unsupported version, we recommend upgrading to a supported version to ensure you receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly. Please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue**: Security issues should not be discussed publicly until they have been properly investigated and patched. Opening a public issue can expose users to potential risks.

2. **Send an email**: Report the vulnerability by sending an email to `ilya@sheremetov.com`. In your email, please include:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any other information that might help us understand and resolve the issue.

3. **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge your email within 72 hours and provide an estimate of when we expect to investigate and address the issue.

4. **Resolution**: We aim to address all security vulnerabilities promptly. Once a fix has been prepared, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure process to ensure that the vulnerability is fully resolved before any public announcement.

## Security Updates

We will notify users about security updates via:

- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/illia-stv/security/advisories) (if applicable)
- Release notes on the [repository's releases page](https://github.com/illia-stv/releases)
- Any other relevant channels where project announcements are made

## Common Security Practices

To ensure the security of your installation:

- **Keep your dependencies up to date**: Regularly update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Use strong credentials**: Always use strong, unique passwords and protect your authentication credentials.
- **Review third-party packages**: If you add new dependencies, review them for known vulnerabilities using tools like [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-audit) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).
